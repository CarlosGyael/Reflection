Today we added on our java adventure. I cant believe we get 2 more hours of break on fridays!
My adventure story was "fenominal" said by the java instructor Mike. I believe it is too but there is always
 something to progress. i can make it even more simple by making more classes. i also made the mistake
 of putting alot of functions within functions. example: if statements within more if statements. i need to break out of 
 those and make my application easier readable. This adventure is due monday and i finished it at 2:00 pm on friday.
 And trust me its a long story..
