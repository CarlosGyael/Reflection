Today i learned a bunch of html code, knowing the import difference between <div> and <table> 
i now know how to manipulate certain parts of my html page. I have also learned how to use networking 
commands and how networking works. this will help when i cant find my ip and how to fix that. 
It applies to everything else i learned about networking/html. I love how many doors there are to open with programming.
Html is all about visual comfort and proffesional displays. There really was alot of information today but with some power point
reviews tonight i think i am able to grasp these commands. This is only day 2 of my tough journey..
